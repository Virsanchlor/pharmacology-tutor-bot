## 💬 Prompt Engineering
This project was developed using a **prompt-driven workflow**.  
See [`prompts.md`](prompts.md) for a detailed log of the prompts, AI responses, and how they were applied in the project.

## 🖼️ Visuals
Screenshots of the detailed log of prompts are stored in the [`/screenshots/`](./screenshots) folder.  

Example:  
- `ligand-binding.png` → Step 1: Signal molecule attaches to GPCR.  
- `g-protein-activation.png` → Step 2: G-protein subunits separate.  
- `second-messenger.png` → Step 3: Messenger molecules relay signal.

## 🧪 Pharmacology Example
- **Drug:** Albuterol (β2-adrenergic agonist)  
- **Mechanism:** Activates GPCR in airway smooth muscle → relaxation → relief in asthma.
