# Project 2 — GPCR Signalling Prompt Log

This file documents the prompts used in the development of **Project 2: GPCR Signalling Lecture & Visuals**.  
The purpose is to provide transparency into the prompt engineering process.

---

## 📌 Prompt 1: Initial Overview
**Prompt:**  
"Describe GPCR signalling in detail, step by step."

**AI Response (Summary):**  
- Explained binding of ligand to GPCR.  
- Activation of G-protein (α, β, γ subunits).  
- Production of secondary messengers (cAMP, IP3).  
- Downstream signalling cascade.  

**Use in Project:**  
Formed the backbone of the first lecture draft.

## 📌 Prompt 2: Simplified Explanation
**Prompt:**  
"Explain GPCR signalling using very simple English synonyms so a medical student/high school grader can understand."

**AI Response (Summary):**  
- Used analogy of a “door and key system” → ligand as the key, receptor as the door, G-protein as wires, secondary messenger as the sound.  
- Broke down complex words into everyday terms.  

**Use in Project:**  
Improved accessibility of lecture material.

## 📌 Prompt 3: Pharmacology Example
**Prompt:**  
"Give me a drug example that uses GPCR signalling."

**AI Response (Summary):**  
- Suggested **Albuterol** (β2-adrenergic agonist) as an example.  
- Explained how it activates GPCR → relaxes airway smooth muscles.  

**Use in Project:**  
Added a real-world pharmacology application.

## 📌 Prompt 4: Quiz Development
**Prompt:**  
"Generate quiz questions that test understanding of GPCR signalling in simple language."

**AI Response (Summary):**  
- Q1: Which subunit holds GDP/GTP in the G-protein??  
- Q2: Which second messenger rises when Gs is active?  
- Q3: What does arrestin do to the receptor?  

**Use in Project:**  
Added to student learning activities.

## 📌 Notes
- Prompts were refined iteratively to balance **technical accuracy** with **simplicity**.  
- Screenshots of generated diagrams are stored in the `/screenshots/` folder.  
- Some responses were edited for clarity before inclusion in the lecture.
